Identifying Personal Identifiable Information in Student Essays

With the emergence of the information age, the ever-growing need to protect personal information has become increasingly important.
Leveraging machine learning, we aim to protect this highly valuable data, by identifying and masking.
This is essential to be able to create and use large open datasets from these sources for use.
Our solution to this is to build a NER model to identify and classify PII using datasets containing a student essay and prelabeled PIIs.
We will build a webpage containing visual of analytics of the PIIs and the training processes.
We hope to also integrate a model into the website, such that user can test the model with their own essays.
Ultimately, we hope to allow research of educational data to happen more smoothly and efficiently while maintaining student privacy.
