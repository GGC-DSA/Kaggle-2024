# Description
Our team is the Algorithm Allies! We are working on a Kaggle project via their Challenges section. Our client will be Dr. Gunay.

The Kaggle Competition we are participating in is the [PII Data Detection hosted by The Learning Agency Lab](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pii-detection-removal-from-educational-data/overview). The objective of the project is to create an AI model that detects personal identifiable information (PII) so they can be censored. This is important when releasing educational material to the public to protect the identity of students. The data is contained in JSONs of student essays that were tokenized using [spaCy](https://spacy.io/).
