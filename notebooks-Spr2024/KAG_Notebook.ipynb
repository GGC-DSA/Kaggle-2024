        "# Identifying PII in Student Essays\n",
        "## Project Summary\n",
        "The goal of this competition is to develop a model that detects sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) in student writing. This is necessary to screen and clean educational data so that when released to the public for analysis and archival, the students' risk are mitigated.\n",

        "Because one of the files is larger than 100MiB, the file could not be uploaded directly to the github repo. The solution found was using git large file system to hold the file and upload the git lfs pointer file in the place of the json.\n",
