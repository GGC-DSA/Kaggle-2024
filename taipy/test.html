Challenge &amp; selection

The tool I use to help all stakeholders finding their way through the complexity of a project is the  mind map.

What exactly is a mind map? According to the definition of Buzan T. and Buzan B. (1999, Dessine-moi  l'intelligence. Paris: Les Éditions d'Organisation.), the mind map (or heuristic diagram) is a graphic  representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain's  potential to be released. Cf Annex1

This tool has many advantages:

•  It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done  quickly

•  It is scalable

•  It allows categorization and linking of information

•  It can be applied to any type of situation: notetaking, problem solving, analysis, creation of  new ideas

•  It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn

•  It is fun and encourages exchanges

•  It makes visible the dimension of projects, opportunities, interconnections

•  It synthesizes

•  It makes the project understandable

•  It allows you to explore ideas

The creation of a mind map starts with an idea/problem located at its center. This starting point  generates ideas/work areas, incremented around this center in a radial structure, which in turn is  completed with as many branches as new ideas.

This tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized, it is a map of the thoughts.

Creativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method.

Application &amp; Insight

I start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board  (white or paper board). In the center of the board, I write and highlight the topic to design.

Through a series of questions, I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map. I adapt the series  of questions according to the topic to be addressed. In the type of questions, we can use: who, what,  when, where, why, how, how much.

The use of the “why” is very interesting to understand the origin. By this way, the interviewed person  frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas / ways of functioning. I plan two  hours for a workshop.

Design Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla

After modelling the mind map on paper, I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their  work with the addition of color codes, images and interconnections. This second workshop also lasts  two hours and allows the mind map to evolve. Once familiarized with it, the stakeholders discover  the power of the tool. Then, the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive  exchanges between the stakeholders. Around this new mind map, they have learned to work  together and want to make visible the untold ideas.

I now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for  decision-makers. These presentations are the core of my business models. The decision-makers are  thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them.  They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation.

Approach

What I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for  the project. This tool helps to give meaning. The participants appropriate the story and want to keep  writing it. Then, they easily become actors or sponsors of the project. A trust relationship is built,  thus facilitating the implementation of related actions.

Design Thinking Assignment

Visualization Tool

Challenge &amp; Selection

The elderly were having a hard time adapting to the changes we brought in our bank. As  a result of a poorly implemented linear solution, a more customer centric approach was  needed.

After learning about design thinking in this course, we decided to apply it to solve this  problem. The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using  diagrams, figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders.  Previous to this change, none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them, but the  new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them  understand the problem in the way the team and I did.

Application

The process starts in the prep time. The team uses a series of tools and software to  develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we  created during the process. The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual  way, rather than verbally was a game changer.

After having a presentation prepared, the team hands an activity to the stakeholders,  where the solutions discussed previously appear. Nonetheless, the solutions need more  work to them. After this. The stakeholders are asked to help complete the solutions  while the team and I create diagrams on a blackboard to represent how their  suggestions would impact on this specific problem.

The use of a group activity strengthens the bond between the company and their  investors. It makes them feel like they take part and help solve the problems as well as  show how customer centric the solutions are. Every complaint and suggestion from  customers are read and evaluated using the graph shown in the course (Involving: can  we do it? Can we afford it? …). The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the  stakeholders on the same page. It allows them to completely understand and feel part  of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions, which eases the  work of the team.

Insight &amp; Approach

The use of this method created a new workflow in the Design Team. It increased the  productivity and the success rate as well as the customer/stakeholders satisfaction. The  use of the visualization tool created an engaged group of people who work together to

Diego Estrada

find a solution based on their customer satisfaction. This solution is later revised and  tweaked with the help of the stakeholders who are deeply involved in the process.

Presentations, graphics, and activities have added a huge increase in satisfaction. As a  company we also learnt that engaging different areas can be difficult because of the  varying levels of understanding, but when paired with the adequate process things just  flow.

(This story is fictional and was created for solving the assignment)

Challenge

I received a promotion of being the Regional Controller, along with my actual position of

Country CFO. The main responsibility of this new position was to weekly report the results

for the week and estimate the final results of the month of 4 countries and consolidated

those.

When I was receiving the position, I went to visit my colleague, former Regional Controller,

who was promoted to Country CEO and now had interest conflicts of being the controller.

The process to consolidate the information of the 4 countries was that the country controllers

sent him an email with the main figures for the week, he forwarded those to his country

accountant who consolidated it, the accountant sent him the consolidated report and he

finally reported to the headquarters. The whole process took almost a full business day to

complete.

Given that my responsibilities as Country CFO demanded more attention because my

country had more operations, I decided to change the process in order to reduce the

duration and to ensure standardization in the format, and actually, reduce the human

intervention, making that the country controllers work directly in the consolidation file.

Selection

Having in mind that there was a different kind of users of file, I select some of those to

determine what was the main important things to take into account in the moment of the

process of the information and the reading of the same. In that sense, we form a group of

the country controllers, country CEOs, IT guys, and people from the headquarters to find the

best solutions possible.

Application

For the first lunch, we focused on the consolidation process in order to avoid the copy-paste

processes and reducing the manual intervention so, we build an online application where all

the controllers fill the figure of their respective country, along with the comments. During the

first week of the first stage, we sent the new report along with the old one, and after the

meeting with the headquarters team, we ask for a post-meeting review of the new format, all

the assistants provided their comments and suggestions that were the input for the next

report.

For the second lunch, we focused on the feedback received from the assistants to the review

meeting, we adjust the report and we were able to eliminate the old one. The final report

included all the suggestions received but the best of all is that reduced the time investment

from about 36 men hours to around 8, without missing any valuable information and

including new data that the stakeholders appreciated so much.

Insight

With the application of the learning launch tool, the controller’s team along with the main

stakeholders identified different assumptions and designed tools to test these assumptions.

On the other hand, we found probable requirements from headquarters, expecting to find

that a more agile approach that improved the workflow, reduced the time investment of

everyone in the team and that both our team and the key stakeholders were very satisfied

with the results of the exercise and the new report.

The final report was slightly different from what we anticipated, but the differences were

more related to form and a few topics to be included in the report.

Approach

Despite that, the team was not used to design thinking tools, they were able to work with the

learning launch that was the appropriate tool. The team needs to review the insight gained

from our first two launches and continuously evaluate this insight and new ones into future

launch designs, especially taking into account that the full automation of the reports will take

at least 4 years more according to the ERP implementation plan of the headquarter.

Challenge

My challenge to solve is the problem of a company that is without

sufficient capital to create and build its own industrial plant, and cannot

cope with the growing demand that they have had in the last two months.

The company is in a dilemma, as it has two potential investors; The first

investor offers the amount of capital necessary for the creation of the

plant, in return he asks to intervene in the process and make certain

changes in the final product since he thinks that the idea he has has

shown good results in previous years and to have the participation of 50%

in the company, the second investor offers the capital necessary for the

creation of the plant in exchange for do not make modifications to the

final product, since this is the one that is generating the exponential

growth of the company, for the moment it is only asked to focus on the

company's success product and as they recover the investment they can

be extended to the innovation of products and creation for a 20% stake

within the company.

As a manager of the company, I need to make the best decision for the

above mentioned one.

Selection

I decided to choose the visualization tool, visualization allows me to

understand and analyze the context, to be able to define the needs and

their possible solutions. This tool is useful for me to have a clearer vision

of the current state of the company and what it ultimately requires;

through this tool I can deduce the personalities of the two investors, such

as George and Geoff; and based on this I can make the best decision.

Application

In the application of my chosen tool to the challenge that I have set

myself, the tool has been of a very wide utility, since when applying it to

my challenge very good results were obtained, since with this I could have

an analysis to the measure of the two investors. The first thing I did with

my visualization tool was to conduct a study to customers who required

the flagship product of the company, first I had to understand why the

demand had had such a strong growth in the last two months, by applying

the tool I could find the answers to this question; I could see that

customers needed this product as it was, without any modification

because the product worked wonders.

With this study of the clients interested in the product, I was able to

analyze and follow up on the proposals I had on the table from the two

investors.

I concluded that I needed the person who was interested in the first

instance to supply the product that was having great success. Which was

the second investor, since he was interested in first of all to give the size

of production that our customers demanded, and then worry about

improving it, but in small and concise steps.

I discarded the first investor, as he did not meet the requirements that the

company needed at that time. I realized that this investor was convinced

that by changing the product to the way he thought, the demand was

going to increase more; but in reality what the company needed was to be

able to cover the demand that the product was having, this investor

wanted to throw everything we had, to the side of the road, but he did not

think for a moment that these modifications should have a low impact in

case things do not go as well as expected.

Thanks to the application of the tool I was able to identify the key points

of the company's needs and how each investor, according to their

proposals, could help me, based on this I made the best decision. I chose

to work with the second investor, we were able to supply the demand for

the product, then the investment tripled and we were able to inject it into

research for product innovation, and make some small changes, which

were being introduced to customers discreetly and in small quantities.

When customers became more interested in the improved product, we

decided to increase production by improving the product.

Perspective

The information and the final lesson that I had when socializing what we

obtained by using the visualization tool, the first thing is that we must

always think first about the needs of customers, of the people interested

in the product; it is very useful to know what the problem is, what is the

cause of the problem and finally build an effective solution. Secondly,

based on what we have obtained, we can find a partner that fits our

needs, and be able to work as a team, unifying ideas and producing

possible solutions. Thanks to the knowledge gained from the design

course, I was able to create a strategic plan for the company's problems

and make it a successful plan.

Approach

What I would apply differently in the challenge would be the tool used, I

would like to use the learning launch; I would do it in the following way,

rejecting the proposals of the two investors and only creating the way that

the production process would be decreased to be able to supply the

required demand. It may or may not work out, but I would like to have

employed this strategy.

Challenge

We are a small company in Barcelona (Spain) that refines high-quality organic cheeses  from small producers in the Pyrenees. We also trade milk and yogurts from these  producers. We distribute our dairy products mainly to haute cuisine restaurants (60% of  our turnover) and to Delicatesens stores (35% of our turnover), the remaining 5% we  distribute to individuals, mainly family, friends and acquaintances.    Selection

I have chosen the "Learning Launch" because it is more adapted to my way of working  and the needs of the company.    Application

Due to the coronavirus crisis, all restaurants have closed and Delicatesen store sales  have dropped dramatically. therefore we have had to change our target niche and head  towards private individuals and common stores.    We have carried out a survey both in small stores and among individuals. In the survey  we asked what types of cheese are the most willing to consume, as well as milk and  yogurts, also the type of milk (goat, cow, sheep), the level of curing and the price they  would be willing to pay for our products. We have also proposed sending boxes with  different products on offer, in which the average price is significantly lower.    After the survey and the observations of individuals and small stores, we have focused  our offer on a certain type of product, we have distributed it and analyzed the result not  only with our customers but also with objective sales figures.    Insight

The result has been spectacular, our weekly turnover had fallen to 25% with a loss of  75% (60% of restaurants and 15% of delicatessen stores). The situation was dramatic  but nowadays sales to individuals have risen from 5% to 25% and common food stores  have gone from 0% to 15%.

Approach

Our situation is not good, but we hope that when the restaurants open and the economy  recovers. We will have a much broader portfolio of clients and a way of working based  on the client and transferred to the producer. Before, we used to transfer products from  small producers to customers. Now the flow has changed.

Challenge:

There is a company which provides financial advisory to customers either in person or virtual.  Lately organisation climate has been seen decayed as result of arguments, hassles and the  lack of fraternity and cooperation among the campaign workers. The aim is improving  climate organisation to transmit unity and trust to our customer.

Selection:

Storytelling is the first tool selected, because this tool allows to connect with the audience,  to make understandable the message, and to transmit emotions. Campaign workers would  feel identified and understand the importance of tolerance and empathy.

Application and insight:

Many stories were told in various sections. Stories from previous experiences, fictional  stories, and stories told by participants created a different atmosphere due to participants  started to produce deeper relationships among them and recognize the importance of being  empathic. An important result was that meeting with clients were longer.

Approach:

The activities work in a good way, but visualization tool would work very well in a challenge  like this. Showing the way, some elements to get a harmonious atmosphere through  visualization is an option in a further situation.

Dr Sakir Ahmad

Challenge &amp; Selection

Be it any organization, team or a government venture, I have often observed that they experience  failures because they couldn’t connect with their audience aptly. In such scenarios, storytelling  can turn the table significantly. I have used the tool ‘storytelling’ in my organization to convey a  complicated message as simply as possible or to generate ideas from people around me. The idea  is to implement this innovative tool to make the intricate issues understandable and engage the  targeted audience. I relayed the context of the story to captivate the attention of the audience. I  have used the technique in front of my team-members of the organization to impart its essence,  brainstorm notions, make productive connections and develop appropriate strategies. The crucial  element in storytelling is to engagingly answer the questions raised in the story to its targeted  audience and allow them to resonate with the core subject of the story. When I shared the story, I  tried to gain the insights from the audience as to how the characters inspire them and how it  related to their work emotions. The information and feedback immensely helped me in  recognizing its importance in finding solutions in real world.

Application

I used the storytelling tool in an organizational meeting to help the team members visualize the  essence and impact of revolutionary thinking. I understood that the story has to make sense so  that they can comprehend the context and relate with it. I started the story of the time when there  was an emergence of deadly diseases due to mosquitoes i.e. malaria etc. and a company brought  a revolution by introducing a range of mosquito repellent products. I emphasized on its out-of- the box thinking &amp; ideas that made the brand conquer the market. I observed that my audience  were sincerely engaged and were emotionally connected with the company. After I finished, there  were questions and productive interactions which exhibited that they relate it with their ongoing  project. The enthusiasm of thinking afresh was quite overwhelming.

Insight &amp; Approach

When I analysed the whole series of events it made me wonder, “Did my tool work? The answer I  think is ‘YES’. Will it serve the purpose? I think that time will tell but I believe it will certainly aid  them in making apt strategies.”

The exercise portrayed that a revolutionary story can influence a small number of people then  storytelling as a design-thinking tool, if implemented efficiently, can bring ground-breaking  changes in organizations &amp; countries. I observed that my story engaged my targeted audience,  inspired them to think new and deliver better results.

As a student of design thinking, I can explore this tool from all corners and can confidently say  that I can creatively use it in number of inspiring ways at any appropriate phase of design thinking  activities.

I take part of a social enterprenuership group in my university. We were in contact

with Capão das Antas, a rural Community in the suburbs of São Carlos (SP-Brazil). We had the  intention to criate, with the local producers, a project that wold improve the quality of life in  the neighborhood. For that, in the first two months we begin to listen each farmer of Capão  and try identify the principal issues of the place and their residentes. After some visits we  concluded that the principal problem was selling the products that they plant in the local  farms. Therefore, we had the objective to make and test a business model that would increase  their rent.

Selection

In order to build a sustainable business model with the farmers, we made a first test

were we delivered the products at the costumer’s door. The action had a good result but we  want to increase even more ours sales. So we used Learning Launchs to test new ideais and  then improve our business model.

Application

After we analise all the data we had and build the business model, Its was far from be

the most sustainable and profitable one. To improve our project, we made a plan to test new  ways of seling. So every week, after we analise all the process from the farm to the costumer  door, we propose and teste the improvement in the current business model.

In order to give examples of how it works, after some weeks we notice that the

farmers were having problems in separate the orders. The costumers were ordering with na  app called whatsapp, but the person who was responsable for taking note of the orders was  messy with the conversations feed. As soon as we notice this problem we proposed a new app  that automatically cluster the orders in a simple feed. Therefore we tested this improvement  in the next week and got zero mistakes in separating the orders.

Insights

The application of Learning Launches showed me how testing is importante in building

a solid business model. Therefore, I learned that the more you test possibles ideias, more  chance of sucess you have. Testing a lot of improvement and ideas is not the fastest way to  achieve a better scenario but is cleary a certainly strategy to get there.

Approach

During all the improvement plan that we act every week we propose changes based on

what we were seeing during the deliveries. I think that we could have achieved better results  by analysis more sources of data, like feedback from all the stakeholders. Besides that we  could have made a better knowledge management of the changes proposed for the business  model.

“Why are people sometimes altruistic?”

Stefano Lovato

MDI-191 student

Sathyabama

April, 2020

In many classical economic theories, it is common to determine a human, as a very egoistic  creature. Adam Smith’s books (but not all of them) were wrote based on this idea also.  However, the conception of Homo economicus was introduced for the first time by John Stuart  Mill in the nineteens century and it assumes, that all human beings are consistently rational,  narrowly self-interested, and who pursue their subjectively-defined ends optimally1. However,  in our real life we face acts of altruism very often: our parents provide us with all necessary  goods, a lot of businessmen give money for charity and even strangers give money to homeless  people. So, it is very clear, that people do not necessarily acts in their own interests all the time,  they also tend to help others. But what makes them to do this? Why are people sometimes  altruistic?

Gerashchenko Igor in his article “The ethical teaching of A. Smith in the context of the modern  economy” writes, that altruism has been existing from the very times of primitive man, as a  single egoistic individual was not capable to survive out of his or her community. All resources  were so difficult to get, that the efforts of the whole pride were essential in struggle for  survival. The following way the system of social values, where helping other people is highly  appreciated, started to form. The ideology of individualism instead of collectivism has appeared  much time later, when the market economy gave us a possibility to live independently from  each other, or to form smaller communities, as nuclear families. But even now, in modern word  and in modern families, we can see people continue to act in altruistic way. So, let’s try to  discover, what other motives, besides ancient habit, do they have.

One of the mechanisms, which makes people act in altruistic way, is called reciprocal (or  mutual) altruism. It means, that individuals tend to help someone, who is likely to give  something back. But it doesn’t mean, that human beings are egoistic. People subconsciously  wait for the same attitude to them after performing altruistic actions (there the golden rule of  morality2 is taken place). Alexander Shmakov, the author of the article “The purpose for just  cooperation as a motive of economic behavior”, provides us with results of the experiment,  which shows the relevancy of the statement, which was made above:

Both of two players (A and B) were provided with a certain amount of money (a and b  respectively). Firstly, player A is asked to give a part of his money to player B, and after that  player B is also asked to give money to A. Both players are free to choose any amount of money  (x or y respectively) they want to give or not to give anything at all.

The rational strategy for both players will be not give money. Because in case, when A decided  to share, it would not be profitable for B to share money (b + xa — yb &lt; b + xa). And if A decided  not to give money, B would not give money either. However, in reality, when the experiment  took place, the results showed that 20 of 30 pairs of students shared their money. The average  received sum of money were 32,5% of the initial one. But in case, when one of the players

1 The definition is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus .  2 Treat people the way you want to be treated.

Player A / Player B  To give money  Not to give

To give money  a + yb — xa, b + xa — yb  a — xa, b + xa

Not to give  a + yb, b — yb  a, b

denied the opportunity of cooperation ones, in most of the cases it put the end for the future  transaction, as the condition of relicense was lost.

One more thing, which can help us to understand the phenomenon of altruism, is economic  games. There exist a lot of such games, but the most famous are “Dictator”, “Ultimatum” and  “The division of the public good”.  In “Dictator” game one the players receives a sum of money,  part of which he/she can give to another player. The rational behavior, which is expected from  the first person, is not to give anything, as only in this case he/she will get the maximum  possible profit. Strangely, but in 616 experiments3, which were carried out, an average given  sum was about 28,35% of the initial sum and only about 1/3 of all participants gave nothing. The  motive for such altruistic action is probably a sense of justice, as the first person did nothing in  order to get money, so he/she thinks, that it would be fair to share them.

Another explanation of altruism is people’s consciousness about their reputation. As I  mentioned above, altruism is socially approved behavior, so individuals, who are known for  helping people around, may be in more respect, than others. So, the motives for the altruistic  actions can be not only empathy, but also concern for the opinion of others.  Charity donations  are a good example of an altruistic action, which has a considerable impact in person’s  reputation. In most of the charity cases only small donations are made anonymously, but  names of people, who donate huge amounts of money, are usually well-known and numerous  times mentioned in newspapers, magazines and TV programs. So, philanthropists may expect  more support from the society, if they need, as they are known as a good person.

Developing the idea about philanthropy, we face another reason for being altruistic. This  motive is about being conscious of the future of the civilization, also known as communal  interest, which differ people from animals. People want to live in comfortable conditions,  where hospitals, education and other social institutions work well enough. So, they are ready to  contribute to the common good in order to provide their families and themselves with better  life. That is why the idea of social altruism appeared. Scientists faced the fact, that they are  unable to explain why people continue help others even, when they do not have any filiation at  all. This type of behavior started to take place, when human’s intentions goes beyond family  and reputational altruism. Ernst Fehr and Urs Fischbacher in their article “Nature of human  altruism” call this phenomenon a strong reciprocity, which works under the possibility of  altruistic remuneration or altruistic punishment (stigmatization).

Taking all things into consideration, we can conclude, that altruism has a significant economic  effect not only on one particular person or a small social group, but on the whole society. And  strange, as it may seem, altruistic behavior can be profitable for the altruist as well as for  someone, who receives help. Moreover, many social organizations, even economic ones, would  not work at all, if people behaved themselves only in egoistic way, as due to desire to get the  maximum possible profit people may break adopted regulations, what may ruin the whole  system.

Challenge &amp; selection

The tool I use to help all stakeholders finding their way through the complexity of a project is the  mind map.

What exactly is a mind map? According to the definition of Buzan T. and Buzan B. (1999, Dessine-moi  l'intelligence. Paris: Les Éditions d'Organisation.), the mind map (or heuristic diagram) is a graphic  representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain's  potential to be released. Cf Annex1

This tool has many advantages:

•  It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done  quickly

•  It is scalable

•  It allows categorization and linking of information

•  It can be applied to any type of situation: notetaking, problem solving, analysis, creation of  new ideas

•  It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn

•  It is fun and encourages exchanges

•  It makes visible the dimension of projects, opportunities, interconnections

•  It synthesizes

•  It makes the project understandable

•  It allows you to explore ideas

The creation of a mind map starts with an idea/problem located at its center. This starting point  generates ideas/work areas, incremented around this center in a radial structure, which in turn is  completed with as many branches as new ideas.

This tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized, it is a map of the thoughts.

Creativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method.

Application &amp; Insight

I start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board  (white or paper board). In the center of the board, I write and highlight the topic to design.

Through a series of questions, I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map. I adapt the series  of questions according to the topic to be addressed. In the type of questions, we can use: who, what,  when, where, why, how, how much.

The use of the “why” is very interesting to understand the origin. By this way, the interviewed person  frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas / ways of functioning. I plan two  hours for a workshop.

Design Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla

After modelling the mind map on paper, I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their  work with the addition of color codes, images and interconnections. This second workshop also lasts  two hours and allows the mind map to evolve. Once familiarized with it, the stakeholders discover  the power of the tool. Then, the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive  exchanges between the stakeholders. Around this new mind map, they have learned to work  together and want to make visible the untold ideas.

I now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for  decision-makers. These presentations are the core of my business models. The decision-makers are  thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them.  They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation.

Approach

What I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for  the project. This tool helps to give meaning. The participants appropriate the story and want to keep  writing it. Then, they easily become actors or sponsors of the project. A trust relationship is built,  thus facilitating the implementation of related actions.

Design Thinking Assignment

Visualization Tool

Challenge &amp; Selection

The elderly were having a hard time adapting to the changes we brought in our bank. As  a result of a poorly implemented linear solution, a more customer centric approach was  needed.

After learning about design thinking in this course, we decided to apply it to solve this  problem. The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using  diagrams, figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders.  Previous to this change, none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them, but the  new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them  understand the problem in the way the team and I did.

Application

The process starts in the prep time. The team uses a series of tools and software to  develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we  created during the process. The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual  way, rather than verbally was a game changer.

After having a presentation prepared, the team hands an activity to the stakeholders,  where the solutions discussed previously appear. Nonetheless, the solutions need more  work to them. After this. The stakeholders are asked to help complete the solutions  while the team and I create diagrams on a blackboard to represent how their  suggestions would impact on this specific problem.

The use of a group activity strengthens the bond between the company and their  investors. It makes them feel like they take part and help solve the problems as well as  show how customer centric the solutions are. Every complaint and suggestion from  customers are read and evaluated using the graph shown in the course (Involving: can  we do it? Can we afford it? …). The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the  stakeholders on the same page. It allows them to completely understand and feel part  of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions, which eases the  work of the team.

Insight &amp; Approach

The use of this method created a new workflow in the Design Team. It increased the  productivity and the success rate as well as the customer/stakeholders satisfaction. The  use of the visualization tool created an engaged group of people who work together to

Diego Estrada

find a solution based on their customer satisfaction. This solution is later revised and  tweaked with the help of the stakeholders who are deeply involved in the process.

Presentations, graphics, and activities have added a huge increase in satisfaction. As a  company we also learnt that engaging different areas can be difficult because of the  varying levels of understanding, but when paired with the adequate process things just  flow.

by Gilberto Gamboa

Challenge

I received a promotion of being the Regional Controller, along with my actual position of

Country CFO. The main responsibility of this new position was to weekly report the results

for the week and estimate the final results of the month of 4 countries and consolidated

those.

When I was receiving the position, I went to visit my colleague, former Regional Controller,

who was promoted to Country CEO and now had interest conflicts of being the controller.

The process to consolidate the information of the 4 countries was that the country controllers

sent him an email with the main figures for the week, he forwarded those to his country

accountant who consolidated it, the accountant sent him the consolidated report and he

finally reported to the headquarters. The whole process took almost a full business day to

complete.

Given that my responsibilities as Country CFO demanded more attention because my

country had more operations, I decided to change the process in order to reduce the

duration and to ensure standardization in the format, and actually, reduce the human

intervention, making that the country controllers work directly in the consolidation file.

Selection

Having in mind that there was a different kind of users of file, I select some of those to

determine what was the main important things to take into account in the moment of the

process of the information and the reading of the same. In that sense, we form a group of

the country controllers, country CEOs, IT guys, and people from the headquarters to find the

best solutions possible.

Application

For the first lunch, we focused on the consolidation process in order to avoid the copy-paste

processes and reducing the manual intervention so, we build an online application where all

the controllers fill the figure of their respective country, along with the comments. During the

first week of the first stage, we sent the new report along with the old one, and after the

meeting with the headquarters team, we ask for a post-meeting review of the new format, all

the assistants provided their comments and suggestions that were the input for the next

report.

For the second lunch, we focused on the feedback received from the assistants to the review

meeting, we adjust the report and we were able to eliminate the old one. The final report

included all the suggestions received but the best of all is that reduced the time investment

from about 36 men hours to around 8, without missing any valuable information and

including new data that the stakeholders appreciated so much.

Insight

With the application of the learning launch tool, the controller’s team along with the main

stakeholders identified different assumptions and designed tools to test these assumptions.

On the other hand, we found probable requirements from headquarters, expecting to find

that a more agile approach that improved the workflow, reduced the time investment of

everyone in the team and that both our team and the key stakeholders were very satisfied

with the results of the exercise and the new report.

The final report was slightly different from what we anticipated, but the differences were

more related to form and a few topics to be included in the report.

Approach

Despite that, the team was not used to design thinking tools, they were able to work with the

learning launch that was the appropriate tool. The team needs to review the insight gained

from our first two launches and continuously evaluate this insight and new ones into future

launch designs, especially taking into account that the full automation of the reports will take

at least 4 years more according to the ERP implementation plan of the headquarter.

Challenge

My challenge to solve is the problem of a company that is without

sufficient capital to create and build its own industrial plant, and cannot

cope with the growing demand that they have had in the last two months.

The company is in a dilemma, as it has two potential investors; The first

investor offers the amount of capital necessary for the creation of the

plant, in return he asks to intervene in the process and make certain

changes in the final product since he thinks that the idea he has has

shown good results in previous years and to have the participation of 50%

in the company, the second investor offers the capital necessary for the

creation of the plant in exchange for do not make modifications to the

final product, since this is the one that is generating the exponential

growth of the company, for the moment it is only asked to focus on the

company's success product and as they recover the investment they can

be extended to the innovation of products and creation for a 20% stake

within the company.

As a manager of the company, I need to make the best decision for the

above mentioned one.

Selection

I decided to choose the visualization tool, visualization allows me to

understand and analyze the context, to be able to define the needs and

their possible solutions. This tool is useful for me to have a clearer vision

of the current state of the company and what it ultimately requires;

through this tool I can deduce the personalities of the two investors, such

as George and Geoff; and based on this I can make the best decision.

Application

In the application of my chosen tool to the challenge that I have set

myself, the tool has been of a very wide utility, since when applying it to

my challenge very good results were obtained, since with this I could have

an analysis to the measure of the two investors. The first thing I did with

my visualization tool was to conduct a study to customers who required

the flagship product of the company, first I had to understand why the

demand had had such a strong growth in the last two months, by applying

the tool I could find the answers to this question; I could see that

customers needed this product as it was, without any modification

because the product worked wonders.

With this study of the clients interested in the product, I was able to

analyze and follow up on the proposals I had on the table from the two

investors.

I concluded that I needed the person who was interested in the first

instance to supply the product that was having great success. Which was

the second investor, since he was interested in first of all to give the size

of production that our customers demanded, and then worry about

improving it, but in small and concise steps.

I discarded the first investor, as he did not meet the requirements that the

company needed at that time. I realized that this investor was convinced

that by changing the product to the way he thought, the demand was

going to increase more; but in reality what the company needed was to be

able to cover the demand that the product was having, this investor

wanted to throw everything we had, to the side of the road, but he did not

think for a moment that these modifications should have a low impact in

case things do not go as well as expected.

Thanks to the application of the tool I was able to identify the key points

of the company's needs and how each investor, according to their

proposals, could help me, based on this I made the best decision. I chose

to work with the second investor, we were able to supply the demand for

the product, then the investment tripled and we were able to inject it into

research for product innovation, and make some small changes, which

were being introduced to customers discreetly and in small quantities.

When customers became more interested in the improved product, we

decided to increase production by improving the product.

Perspective

The information and the final lesson that I had when socializing what we

obtained by using the visualization tool, the first thing is that we must

always think first about the needs of customers, of the people interested

in the product; it is very useful to know what the problem is, what is the

cause of the problem and finally build an effective solution. Secondly,

based on what we have obtained, we can find a partner that fits our

needs, and be able to work as a team, unifying ideas and producing

possible solutions. Thanks to the knowledge gained from the design

course, I was able to create a strategic plan for the company's problems

and make it a successful plan.

Approach

What I would apply differently in the challenge would be the tool used, I

would like to use the learning launch; I would do it in the following way,

rejecting the proposals of the two investors and only creating the way that

the production process would be decreased to be able to supply the

required demand. It may or may not work out, but I would like to have

employed this strategy.

Challenge

We are a small company in Barcelona (Spain) that refines high-quality organic cheeses  from small producers in the Pyrenees. We also trade milk and yogurts from these  producers. We distribute our dairy products mainly to haute cuisine restaurants (60% of  our turnover) and to Delicatesens stores (35% of our turnover), the remaining 5% we  distribute to individuals, mainly family, friends and acquaintances.    Selection

I have chosen the "Learning Launch" because it is more adapted to my way of working  and the needs of the company.    Application

Due to the coronavirus crisis, all restaurants have closed and Delicatesen store sales  have dropped dramatically. therefore we have had to change our target niche and head  towards private individuals and common stores.    We have carried out a survey both in small stores and among individuals. In the survey  we asked what types of cheese are the most willing to consume, as well as milk and  yogurts, also the type of milk (goat, cow, sheep), the level of curing and the price they  would be willing to pay for our products. We have also proposed sending boxes with  different products on offer, in which the average price is significantly lower.    After the survey and the observations of individuals and small stores, we have focused  our offer on a certain type of product, we have distributed it and analyzed the result not  only with our customers but also with objective sales figures.    Insight

The result has been spectacular, our weekly turnover had fallen to 25% with a loss of  75% (60% of restaurants and 15% of delicatessen stores). The situation was dramatic  but nowadays sales to individuals have risen from 5% to 25% and common food stores  have gone from 0% to 15%.

Approach

Our situation is not good, but we hope that when the restaurants open and the economy  recovers. We will have a much broader portfolio of clients and a way of working based  on the client and transferred to the producer. Before, we used to transfer products from  small producers to customers. Now the flow has changed.

Challenge:

There is a company which provides financial advisory to customers either in person or virtual.  Lately organisation climate has been seen decayed as result of arguments, hassles and the  lack of fraternity and cooperation among the campaign workers. The aim is improving  climate organisation to transmit unity and trust to our customer.

Selection:

Storytelling is the first tool selected, because this tool allows to connect with the audience,  to make understandable the message, and to transmit emotions. Campaign workers would  feel identified and understand the importance of tolerance and empathy.

Application and insight:

Many stories were told in various sections. Stories from previous experiences, fictional  stories, and stories told by participants created a different atmosphere due to participants  started to produce deeper relationships among them and recognize the importance of being  empathic. An important result was that meeting with clients were longer.

Approach:

The activities work in a good way, but visualization tool would work very well in a challenge  like this. Showing the way, some elements to get a harmonious atmosphere through  visualization is an option in a further situation.

Challenge &amp; Selection

Be it any organization, team or a government venture, I have often observed that they experience  failures because they couldn’t connect with their audience aptly. In such scenarios, storytelling  can turn the table significantly. I have used the tool ‘storytelling’ in my organization to convey a  complicated message as simply as possible or to generate ideas from people around me. The idea  is to implement this innovative tool to make the intricate issues understandable and engage the  targeted audience. I relayed the context of the story to captivate the attention of the audience. I  have used the technique in front of my team-members of the organization to impart its essence,  brainstorm notions, make productive connections and develop appropriate strategies. The crucial  element in storytelling is to engagingly answer the questions raised in the story to its targeted  audience and allow them to resonate with the core subject of the story. When I shared the story, I  tried to gain the insights from the audience as to how the characters inspire them and how it  related to their work emotions. The information and feedback immensely helped me in  recognizing its importance in finding solutions in real world.

Application

I used the storytelling tool in an organizational meeting to help the team members visualize the  essence and impact of revolutionary thinking. I understood that the story has to make sense so  that they can comprehend the context and relate with it. I started the story of the time when there  was an emergence of deadly diseases due to mosquitoes i.e. malaria etc. and a company brought  a revolution by introducing a range of mosquito repellent products. I emphasized on its out-of- the box thinking &amp; ideas that made the brand conquer the market. I observed that my audience  were sincerely engaged and were emotionally connected with the company. After I finished, there  were questions and productive interactions which exhibited that they relate it with their ongoing  project. The enthusiasm of thinking afresh was quite overwhelming.

Insight &amp; Approach

When I analysed the whole series of events it made me wonder, “Did my tool work? The answer I  think is ‘YES’. Will it serve the purpose? I think that time will tell but I believe it will certainly aid  them in making apt strategies.”

The exercise portrayed that a revolutionary story can influence a small number of people then  storytelling as a design-thinking tool, if implemented efficiently, can bring ground-breaking  changes in organizations &amp; countries. I observed that my story engaged my targeted audience,  inspired them to think new and deliver better results.

As a student of design thinking, I can explore this tool from all corners and can confidently say  that I can creatively use it in number of inspiring ways at any appropriate phase of design thinking  activities.

Francisco Ferreira

Challenge

I take part of a social enterprenuership group in my university. We were in contact

with Capão das Antas, a rural Community in the suburbs of São Carlos (SP-Brazil). We had the  intention to criate, with the local producers, a project that wold improve the quality of life in  the neighborhood. For that, in the first two months we begin to listen each farmer of Capão  and try identify the principal issues of the place and their residentes. After some visits we  concluded that the principal problem was selling the products that they plant in the local  farms. Therefore, we had the objective to make and test a business model that would increase  their rent.

Selection

In order to build a sustainable business model with the farmers, we made a first test

were we delivered the products at the costumer’s door. The action had a good result but we  want to increase even more ours sales. So we used Learning Launchs to test new ideais and  then improve our business model.

Application

After we analise all the data we had and build the business model, Its was far from be

the most sustainable and profitable one. To improve our project, we made a plan to test new  ways of seling. So every week, after we analise all the process from the farm to the costumer  door, we propose and teste the improvement in the current business model.

In order to give examples of how it works, after some weeks we notice that the

farmers were having problems in separate the orders. The costumers were ordering with na  app called whatsapp, but the person who was responsable for taking note of the orders was  messy with the conversations feed. As soon as we notice this problem we proposed a new app  that automatically cluster the orders in a simple feed. Therefore we tested this improvement  in the next week and got zero mistakes in separating the orders.

Insights

The application of Learning Launches showed me how testing is importante in building

a solid business model. Therefore, I learned that the more you test possibles ideias, more  chance of sucess you have. Testing a lot of improvement and ideas is not the fastest way to  achieve a better scenario but is cleary a certainly strategy to get there.

Approach

During all the improvement plan that we act every week we propose changes based on

what we were seeing during the deliveries. I think that we could have achieved better results  by analysis more sources of data, like feedback from all the stakeholders. Besides that we  could have made a better knowledge management of the changes proposed for the business  model.

Topic 7

“Why are people sometimes altruistic?”

Stefano Lovato

MDI-191 student

Sathyabama

April, 2020

In many classical economic theories, it is common to determine a human, as a very egoistic  creature. Adam Smith’s books (but not all of them) were wrote based on this idea also.  However, the conception of Homo economicus was introduced for the first time by John Stuart  Mill in the nineteens century and it assumes, that all human beings are consistently rational,  narrowly self-interested, and who pursue their subjectively-defined ends optimally1. However,  in our real life we face acts of altruism very often: our parents provide us with all necessary  goods, a lot of businessmen give money for charity and even strangers give money to homeless  people. So, it is very clear, that people do not necessarily acts in their own interests all the time,  they also tend to help others. But what makes them to do this? Why are people sometimes  altruistic?

Gerashchenko Igor in his article “The ethical teaching of A. Smith in the context of the modern  economy” writes, that altruism has been existing from the very times of primitive man, as a  single egoistic individual was not capable to survive out of his or her community. All resources  were so difficult to get, that the efforts of the whole pride were essential in struggle for  survival. The following way the system of social values, where helping other people is highly  appreciated, started to form. The ideology of individualism instead of collectivism has appeared  much time later, when the market economy gave us a possibility to live independently from  each other, or to form smaller communities, as nuclear families. But even now, in modern word  and in modern families, we can see people continue to act in altruistic way. So, let’s try to  discover, what other motives, besides ancient habit, do they have.

One of the mechanisms, which makes people act in altruistic way, is called reciprocal (or  mutual) altruism. It means, that individuals tend to help someone, who is likely to give  something back. But it doesn’t mean, that human beings are egoistic. People subconsciously  wait for the same attitude to them after performing altruistic actions (there the golden rule of  morality2 is taken place). Alexander Shmakov, the author of the article “The purpose for just  cooperation as a motive of economic behavior”, provides us with results of the experiment,  which shows the relevancy of the statement, which was made above:

Both of two players (A and B) were provided with a certain amount of money (a and b  respectively). Firstly, player A is asked to give a part of his money to player B, and after that  player B is also asked to give money to A. Both players are free to choose any amount of money  (x or y respectively) they want to give or not to give anything at all.

The rational strategy for both players will be not give money. Because in case, when A decided  to share, it would not be profitable for B to share money (b + xa — yb &lt; b + xa). And if A decided  not to give money, B would not give money either. However, in reality, when the experiment  took place, the results showed that 20 of 30 pairs of students shared their money. The average  received sum of money were 32,5% of the initial one. But in case, when one of the players

1 The definition is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus .  2 Treat people the way you want to be treated.

Player A / Player B  To give money  Not to give

To give money  a + yb — xa, b + xa — yb  a — xa, b + xa

Not to give  a + yb, b — yb  a, b

denied the opportunity of cooperation ones, in most of the cases it put the end for the future  transaction, as the condition of relicense was lost.

One more thing, which can help us to understand the phenomenon of altruism, is economic  games. There exist a lot of such games, but the most famous are “Dictator”, “Ultimatum” and  “The division of the public good”.  In “Dictator” game one the players receives a sum of money,  part of which he/she can give to another player. The rational behavior, which is expected from  the first person, is not to give anything, as only in this case he/she will get the maximum  possible profit. Strangely, but in 616 experiments3, which were carried out, an average given  sum was about 28,35% of the initial sum and only about 1/3 of all participants gave nothing. The  motive for such altruistic action is probably a sense of justice, as the first person did nothing in  order to get money, so he/she thinks, that it would be fair to share them.

Another explanation of altruism is people’s consciousness about their reputation. As I  mentioned above, altruism is socially approved behavior, so individuals, who are known for  helping people around, may be in more respect, than others. So, the motives for the altruistic  actions can be not only empathy, but also concern for the opinion of others.  Charity donations  are a good example of an altruistic action, which has a considerable impact in person’s  reputation. In most of the charity cases only small donations are made anonymously, but  names of people, who donate huge amounts of money, are usually well-known and numerous  times mentioned in newspapers, magazines and TV programs. So, philanthropists may expect  more support from the society, if they need, as they are known as a good person.

Developing the idea about philanthropy, we face another reason for being altruistic. This  motive is about being conscious of the future of the civilization, also known as communal  interest, which differ people from animals. People want to live in comfortable conditions,  where hospitals, education and other social institutions work well enough. So, they are ready to  contribute to the common good in order to provide their families and themselves with better  life. That is why the idea of social altruism appeared. Scientists faced the fact, that they are  unable to explain why people continue help others even, when they do not have any filiation at  all. This type of behavior started to take place, when human’s intentions goes beyond family  and reputational altruism. Ernst Fehr and Urs Fischbacher in their article “Nature of human  altruism” call this phenomenon a strong reciprocity, which works under the possibility of  altruistic remuneration or altruistic punishment (stigmatization).

Taking all things into consideration, we can conclude, that altruism has a significant economic  effect not only on one particular person or a small social group, but on the whole society. And  strange, as it may seem, altruistic behavior can be profitable for the altruist as well as for  someone, who receives help. Moreover, many social organizations, even economic ones, would  not work at all, if people behaved themselves only in egoistic way, as due to desire to get the  maximum possible profit people may break adopted regulations, what may ruin the whole  system.

Challenge &amp; selection

The tool I use to help all stakeholders finding their way through the complexity of a project is the  mind map.

What exactly is a mind map? According to the definition of Buzan T. and Buzan B. (1999, Dessine-moi  l'intelligence. Paris: Les Éditions d'Organisation.), the mind map (or heuristic diagram) is a graphic  representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain's  potential to be released. Cf Annex1

This tool has many advantages:

•  It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done  quickly

•  It is scalable

•  It allows categorization and linking of information

•  It can be applied to any type of situation: notetaking, problem solving, analysis, creation of  new ideas

•  It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn

•  It is fun and encourages exchanges

•  It makes visible the dimension of projects, opportunities, interconnections

•  It synthesizes

•  It makes the project understandable

•  It allows you to explore ideas

The creation of a mind map starts with an idea/problem located at its center. This starting point  generates ideas/work areas, incremented around this center in a radial structure, which in turn is  completed with as many branches as new ideas.

This tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized, it is a map of the thoughts.

Creativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method.

Application &amp; Insight

I start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board  (white or paper board). In the center of the board, I write and highlight the topic to design.

Through a series of questions, I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map. I adapt the series  of questions according to the topic to be addressed. In the type of questions, we can use: who, what,  when, where, why, how, how much.

The use of the “why” is very interesting to understand the origin. By this way, the interviewed person  frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas / ways of functioning. I plan two  hours for a workshop.

Design Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla

After modelling the mind map on paper, I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their  work with the addition of color codes, images and interconnections. This second workshop also lasts  two hours and allows the mind map to evolve. Once familiarized with it, the stakeholders discover  the power of the tool. Then, the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive  exchanges between the stakeholders. Around this new mind map, they have learned to work  together and want to make visible the untold ideas.

I now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for  decision-makers. These presentations are the core of my business models. The decision-makers are  thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them.  They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation.

Approach

What I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for  the project. This tool helps to give meaning. The participants appropriate the story and want to keep  writing it. Then, they easily become actors or sponsors of the project. A trust relationship is built,  thus facilitating the implementation of related actions.

Design Thinking Assignment

Visualization Tool

Challenge &amp; Selection

The elderly were having a hard time adapting to the changes we brought in our bank. As  a result of a poorly implemented linear solution, a more customer centric approach was  needed.

After learning about design thinking in this course, we decided to apply it to solve this  problem. The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using  diagrams, figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders.  Previous to this change, none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them, but the  new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them  understand the problem in the way the team and I did.

Application

The process starts in the prep time. The team uses a series of tools and software to  develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we  created during the process. The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual  way, rather than verbally was a game changer.

After having a presentation prepared, the team hands an activity to the stakeholders,  where the solutions discussed previously appear. Nonetheless, the solutions need more  work to them. After this. The stakeholders are asked to help complete the solutions  while the team and I create diagrams on a blackboard to represent how their  suggestions would impact on this specific problem.

The use of a group activity strengthens the bond between the company and their  investors. It makes them feel like they take part and help solve the problems as well as  show how customer centric the solutions are. Every complaint and suggestion from  customers are read and evaluated using the graph shown in the course (Involving: can  we do it? Can we afford it? …). The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the  stakeholders on the same page. It allows them to completely understand and feel part  of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions, which eases the  work of the team.

Insight &amp; Approach

The use of this method created a new workflow in the Design Team. It increased the  productivity and the success rate as well as the customer/stakeholders satisfaction. The  use of the visualization tool created an engaged group of people who work together to

Diego Estrada

find a solution based on their customer satisfaction. This solution is later revised and  tweaked with the help of the stakeholders who are deeply involved in the process.

Presentations, graphics, and activities have added a huge increase in satisfaction. As a  company we also learnt that engaging different areas can be difficult because of the  varying levels of understanding, but when paired with the adequate process things just  flow.

Challenge

I received a promotion of being the Regional Controller, along with my actual position of

Country CFO. The main responsibility of this new position was to weekly report the results

for the week and estimate the final results of the month of 4 countries and consolidated

those.

When I was receiving the position, I went to visit my colleague, former Regional Controller,

who was promoted to Country CEO and now had interest conflicts of being the controller.

The process to consolidate the information of the 4 countries was that the country controllers

sent him an email with the main figures for the week, he forwarded those to his country

accountant who consolidated it, the accountant sent him the consolidated report and he

finally reported to the headquarters. The whole process took almost a full business day to

complete.

Given that my responsibilities as Country CFO demanded more attention because my

country had more operations, I decided to change the process in order to reduce the

duration and to ensure standardization in the format, and actually, reduce the human

intervention, making that the country controllers work directly in the consolidation file.

Selection

Having in mind that there was a different kind of users of file, I select some of those to

determine what was the main important things to take into account in the moment of the

process of the information and the reading of the same. In that sense, we form a group of

the country controllers, country CEOs, IT guys, and people from the headquarters to find the

best solutions possible.

Application

For the first lunch, we focused on the consolidation process in order to avoid the copy-paste

processes and reducing the manual intervention so, we build an online application where all

the controllers fill the figure of their respective country, along with the comments. During the

first week of the first stage, we sent the new report along with the old one, and after the

meeting with the headquarters team, we ask for a post-meeting review of the new format, all

the assistants provided their comments and suggestions that were the input for the next

report.

For the second lunch, we focused on the feedback received from the assistants to the review

meeting, we adjust the report and we were able to eliminate the old one. The final report

included all the suggestions received but the best of all is that reduced the time investment

from about 36 men hours to around 8, without missing any valuable information and

including new data that the stakeholders appreciated so much.

Insight

With the application of the learning launch tool, the controller’s team along with the main

stakeholders identified different assumptions and designed tools to test these assumptions.

On the other hand, we found probable requirements from headquarters, expecting to find

that a more agile approach that improved the workflow, reduced the time investment of

everyone in the team and that both our team and the key stakeholders were very satisfied

with the results of the exercise and the new report.

The final report was slightly different from what we anticipated, but the differences were

more related to form and a few topics to be included in the report.

Approach

Despite that, the team was not used to design thinking tools, they were able to work with the

learning launch that was the appropriate tool. The team needs to review the insight gained

from our first two launches and continuously evaluate this insight and new ones into future

launch designs, especially taking into account that the full automation of the reports will take

at least 4 years more according to the ERP implementation plan of the headquarter.

Challenge

My challenge to solve is the problem of a company that is without

sufficient capital to create and build its own industrial plant, and cannot

cope with the growing demand that they have had in the last two months.

The company is in a dilemma, as it has two potential investors; The first

investor offers the amount of capital necessary for the creation of the

plant, in return he asks to intervene in the process and make certain

changes in the final product since he thinks that the idea he has has

shown good results in previous years and to have the participation of 50%

in the company, the second investor offers the capital necessary for the

creation of the plant in exchange for do not make modifications to the

final product, since this is the one that is generating the exponential

growth of the company, for the moment it is only asked to focus on the

company's success product and as they recover the investment they can

be extended to the innovation of products and creation for a 20% stake

within the company.

As a manager of the company, I need to make the best decision for the

above mentioned one.

Selection

I decided to choose the visualization tool, visualization allows me to

understand and analyze the context, to be able to define the needs and

their possible solutions. This tool is useful for me to have a clearer vision

of the current state of the company and what it ultimately requires;

through this tool I can deduce the personalities of the two investors, such

as George and Geoff; and based on this I can make the best decision.

Application

In the application of my chosen tool to the challenge that I have set

myself, the tool has been of a very wide utility, since when applying it to

my challenge very good results were obtained, since with this I could have

an analysis to the measure of the two investors. The first thing I did with

my visualization tool was to conduct a study to customers who required

the flagship product of the company, first I had to understand why the

demand had had such a strong growth in the last two months, by applying

the tool I could find the answers to this question; I could see that

customers needed this product as it was, without any modification

because the product worked wonders.

With this study of the clients interested in the product, I was able to

analyze and follow up on the proposals I had on the table from the two

investors.

I concluded that I needed the person who was interested in the first

instance to supply the product that was having great success. Which was

the second investor, since he was interested in first of all to give the size

of production that our customers demanded, and then worry about

improving it, but in small and concise steps.

I discarded the first investor, as he did not meet the requirements that the

company needed at that time. I realized that this investor was convinced

that by changing the product to the way he thought, the demand was

going to increase more; but in reality what the company needed was to be

able to cover the demand that the product was having, this investor

wanted to throw everything we had, to the side of the road, but he did not

think for a moment that these modifications should have a low impact in

case things do not go as well as expected.

Thanks to the application of the tool I was able to identify the key points

of the company's needs and how each investor, according to their

proposals, could help me, based on this I made the best decision. I chose

to work with the second investor, we were able to supply the demand for

the product, then the investment tripled and we were able to inject it into

research for product innovation, and make some small changes, which

were being introduced to customers discreetly and in small quantities.

When customers became more interested in the improved product, we

decided to increase production by improving the product.

Perspective

The information and the final lesson that I had when socializing what we

obtained by using the visualization tool, the first thing is that we must

always think first about the needs of customers, of the people interested

in the product; it is very useful to know what the problem is, what is the

cause of the problem and finally build an effective solution. Secondly,

based on what we have obtained, we can find a partner that fits our

needs, and be able to work as a team, unifying ideas and producing

possible solutions. Thanks to the knowledge gained from the design

course, I was able to create a strategic plan for the company's problems

and make it a successful plan.

Approach

What I would apply differently in the challenge would be the tool used, I

would like to use the learning launch; I would do it in the following way,

rejecting the proposals of the two investors and only creating the way that

the production process would be decreased to be able to supply the

required demand. It may or may not work out, but I would like to have

employed this strategy.

Challenge

We are a small company in Barcelona (Spain) that refines high-quality organic cheeses  from small producers in the Pyrenees. We also trade milk and yogurts from these  producers. We distribute our dairy products mainly to haute cuisine restaurants (60% of  our turnover) and to Delicatesens stores (35% of our turnover), the remaining 5% we  distribute to individuals, mainly family, friends and acquaintances.    Selection

I have chosen the "Learning Launch" because it is more adapted to my way of working  and the needs of the company.    Application

Due to the coronavirus crisis, all restaurants have closed and Delicatesen store sales  have dropped dramatically. therefore we have had to change our target niche and head  towards private individuals and common stores.    We have carried out a survey both in small stores and among individuals. In the survey  we asked what types of cheese are the most willing to consume, as well as milk and  yogurts, also the type of milk (goat, cow, sheep), the level of curing and the price they  would be willing to pay for our products. We have also proposed sending boxes with  different products on offer, in which the average price is significantly lower.    After the survey and the observations of individuals and small stores, we have focused  our offer on a certain type of product, we have distributed it and analyzed the result not  only with our customers but also with objective sales figures.    Insight

The result has been spectacular, our weekly turnover had fallen to 25% with a loss of  75% (60% of restaurants and 15% of delicatessen stores). The situation was dramatic  but nowadays sales to individuals have risen from 5% to 25% and common food stores  have gone from 0% to 15%.

Approach

Our situation is not good, but we hope that when the restaurants open and the economy  recovers. We will have a much broader portfolio of clients and a way of working based  on the client and transferred to the producer. Before, we used to transfer products from  small producers to customers. Now the flow has changed.

Challenge &amp; Selection

Be it any organization, team or a government venture, I have often observed that they experience  failures because they couldn’t connect with their audience aptly. In such scenarios, storytelling  can turn the table significantly. I have used the tool ‘storytelling’ in my organization to convey a  complicated message as simply as possible or to generate ideas from people around me. The idea  is to implement this innovative tool to make the intricate issues understandable and engage the  targeted audience. I relayed the context of the story to captivate the attention of the audience. I  have used the technique in front of my team-members of the organization to impart its essence,  brainstorm notions, make productive connections and develop appropriate strategies. The crucial  element in storytelling is to engagingly answer the questions raised in the story to its targeted  audience and allow them to resonate with the core subject of the story. When I shared the story, I  tried to gain the insights from the audience as to how the characters inspire them and how it  related to their work emotions. The information and feedback immensely helped me in  recognizing its importance in finding solutions in real world.

Application

I used the storytelling tool in an organizational meeting to help the team members visualize the  essence and impact of revolutionary thinking. I understood that the story has to make sense so  that they can comprehend the context and relate with it. I started the story of the time when there  was an emergence of deadly diseases due to mosquitoes i.e. malaria etc. and a company brought  a revolution by introducing a range of mosquito repellent products. I emphasized on its out-of- the box thinking &amp; ideas that made the brand conquer the market. I observed that my audience  were sincerely engaged and were emotionally connected with the company. After I finished, there  were questions and productive interactions which exhibited that they relate it with their ongoing  project. The enthusiasm of thinking afresh was quite overwhelming.

Insight &amp; Approach

When I analysed the whole series of events it made me wonder, “Did my tool work? The answer I  think is ‘YES’. Will it serve the purpose? I think that time will tell but I believe it will certainly aid  them in making apt strategies.”

The exercise portrayed that a revolutionary story can influence a small number of people then  storytelling as a design-thinking tool, if implemented efficiently, can bring ground-breaking  changes in organizations &amp; countries. I observed that my story engaged my targeted audience,  inspired them to think new and deliver better results.

As a student of design thinking, I can explore this tool from all corners and can confidently say  that I can creatively use it in number of inspiring ways at any appropriate phase of design thinking  activities.

Francisco Ferreira

Challenge

I take part of a social enterprenuership group in my university. We were in contact

with Capão das Antas, a rural Community in the suburbs of São Carlos (SP-Brazil). We had the  intention to criate, with the local producers, a project that wold improve the quality of life in  the neighborhood. For that, in the first two months we begin to listen each farmer of Capão  and try identify the principal issues of the place and their residentes. After some visits we  concluded that the principal problem was selling the products that they plant in the local  farms. Therefore, we had the objective to make and test a business model that would increase  their rent.

Selection

In order to build a sustainable business model with the farmers, we made a first test

were we delivered the products at the costumer’s door. The action had a good result but we  want to increase even more ours sales. So we used Learning Launchs to test new ideais and  then improve our business model.

Application

After we analise all the data we had and build the business model, Its was far from be

the most sustainable and profitable one. To improve our project, we made a plan to test new  ways of seling. So every week, after we analise all the process from the farm to the costumer  door, we propose and teste the improvement in the current business model.

In order to give examples of how it works, after some weeks we notice that the

farmers were having problems in separate the orders. The costumers were ordering with na  app called whatsapp, but the person who was responsable for taking note of the orders was  messy with the conversations feed. As soon as we notice this problem we proposed a new app  that automatically cluster the orders in a simple feed. Therefore we tested this improvement  in the next week and got zero mistakes in separating the orders.

Insights

The application of Learning Launches showed me how testing is importante in building

a solid business model. Therefore, I learned that the more you test possibles ideias, more  chance of sucess you have. Testing a lot of improvement and ideas is not the fastest way to  achieve a better scenario but is cleary a certainly strategy to get there.

Approach

During all the improvement plan that we act every week we propose changes based on

what we were seeing during the deliveries. I think that we could have achieved better results  by analysis more sources of data, like feedback from all the stakeholders. Besides that we  could have made a better knowledge management of the changes proposed for the business  model.

“Why are people sometimes altruistic?”

Stefano Lovato

MDI-191 student

Sathyabama

April, 2020

In many classical economic theories, it is common to determine a human, as a very egoistic  creature. Adam Smith’s books (but not all of them) were wrote based on this idea also.  However, the conception of Homo economicus was introduced for the first time by John Stuart  Mill in the nineteens century and it assumes, that all human beings are consistently rational,  narrowly self-interested, and who pursue their subjectively-defined ends optimally1. However,  in our real life we face acts of altruism very often: our parents provide us with all necessary  goods, a lot of businessmen give money for charity and even strangers give money to homeless  people. So, it is very clear, that people do not necessarily acts in their own interests all the time,  they also tend to help others. But what makes them to do this? Why are people sometimes  altruistic?

Gerashchenko Igor in his article “The ethical teaching of A. Smith in the context of the modern  economy” writes, that altruism has been existing from the very times of primitive man, as a  single egoistic individual was not capable to survive out of his or her community. All resources  were so difficult to get, that the efforts of the whole pride were essential in struggle for  survival. The following way the system of social values, where helping other people is highly  appreciated, started to form. The ideology of individualism instead of collectivism has appeared  much time later, when the market economy gave us a possibility to live independently from  each other, or to form smaller communities, as nuclear families. But even now, in modern word  and in modern families, we can see people continue to act in altruistic way. So, let’s try to  discover, what other motives, besides ancient habit, do they have.

One of the mechanisms, which makes people act in altruistic way, is called reciprocal (or  mutual) altruism. It means, that individuals tend to help someone, who is likely to give  something back. But it doesn’t mean, that human beings are egoistic. People subconsciously  wait for the same attitude to them after performing altruistic actions (there the golden rule of  morality2 is taken place). Alexander Shmakov, the author of the article “The purpose for just  cooperation as a motive of economic behavior”, provides us with results of the experiment,  which shows the relevancy of the statement, which was made above:

Both of two players (A and B) were provided with a certain amount of money (a and b  respectively). Firstly, player A is asked to give a part of his money to player B, and after that  player B is also asked to give money to A. Both players are free to choose any amount of money  (x or y respectively) they want to give or not to give anything at all.

The rational strategy for both players will be not give money. Because in case, when A decided  to share, it would not be profitable for B to share money (b + xa — yb &lt; b + xa). And if A decided  not to give money, B would not give money either. However, in reality, when the experiment  took place, the results showed that 20 of 30 pairs of students shared their money. The average  received sum of money were 32,5% of the initial one. But in case, when one of the players

1 The definition is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus .  2 Treat people the way you want to be treated.

Player A / Player B  To give money  Not to give

To give money  a + yb — xa, b + xa — yb  a — xa, b + xa

Not to give  a + yb, b — yb  a, b

denied the opportunity of cooperation ones, in most of the cases it put the end for the future  transaction, as the condition of relicense was lost.

One more thing, which can help us to understand the phenomenon of altruism, is economic  games. There exist a lot of such games, but the most famous are “Dictator”, “Ultimatum” and  “The division of the public good”.  In “Dictator” game one the players receives a sum of money,  part of which he/she can give to another player. The rational behavior, which is expected from  the first person, is not to give anything, as only in this case he/she will get the maximum  possible profit. Strangely, but in 616 experiments3, which were carried out, an average given  sum was about 28,35% of the initial sum and only about 1/3 of all participants gave nothing. The  motive for such altruistic action is probably a sense of justice, as the first person did nothing in  order to get money, so he/she thinks, that it would be fair to share them.

Another explanation of altruism is people’s consciousness about their reputation. As I  mentioned above, altruism is socially approved behavior, so individuals, who are known for  helping people around, may be in more respect, than others. So, the motives for the altruistic  actions can be not only empathy, but also concern for the opinion of others.  Charity donations  are a good example of an altruistic action, which has a considerable impact in person’s  reputation. In most of the charity cases only small donations are made anonymously, but  names of people, who donate huge amounts of money, are usually well-known and numerous  times mentioned in newspapers, magazines and TV programs. So, philanthropists may expect  more support from the society, if they need, as they are known as a good person.

Developing the idea about philanthropy, we face another reason for being altruistic. This  motive is about being conscious of the future of the civilization, also known as communal  interest, which differ people from animals. People want to live in comfortable conditions,  where hospitals, education and other social institutions work well enough. So, they are ready to  contribute to the common good in order to provide their families and themselves with better  life. That is why the idea of social altruism appeared. Scientists faced the fact, that they are  unable to explain why people continue help others even, when they do not have any filiation at  all. This type of behavior started to take place, when human’s intentions goes beyond family  and reputational altruism. Ernst Fehr and Urs Fischbacher in their article “Nature of human  altruism” call this phenomenon a strong reciprocity, which works under the possibility of  altruistic remuneration or altruistic punishment (stigmatization).

Taking all things into consideration, we can conclude, that altruism has a significant economic  effect not only on one particular person or a small social group, but on the whole society. And  strange, as it may seem, altruistic behavior can be profitable for the altruist as well as for  someone, who receives help. Moreover, many social organizations, even economic ones, would  not work at all, if people behaved themselves only in egoistic way, as due to desire to get the  maximum possible profit people may break adopted regulations, what may ruin the whole  system.

However,theconceptionofHomoeconomicuswasintroducedforthefirsttimebyJohnStuart Millinthenineteenscenturyanditassumes,thatallhumanbeingsareconsistentlyrational, narrowlyself-interested,andwhopursuetheirsubjectively-definedendsoptimally1.However, inourreallifewefaceactsofaltruismveryoften:ourparentsprovideuswithallnecessary goods,alotofbusinessmengivemoneyforcharityandevenstrangersgivemoneytohomeless people.So,itisveryclear,thatpeopledonotnecessarilyactsintheirowninterestsallthetime, theyalsotendtohelpothers.Butwhatmakesthemtodothis?Whyarepeoplesometimes altruistic?

GerashchenkoIgorinhisarticle“TheethicalteachingofA.Smithinthecontextofthemodern economy”writes,thataltruismhasbeenexistingfromtheverytimesofprimitiveman,asa singleegoisticindividualwasnotcapabletosurviveoutofhisorhercommunity.Allresources weresodifficulttoget,thattheeffortsofthewholepridewereessentialinstrugglefor survival.Thefollowingwaythesystemofsocialvalues,wherehelpingotherpeopleishighly appreciated,startedtoform.Theideologyofindividualisminsteadofcollectivismhasappeared muchtimelater,whenthemarketeconomygaveusapossibilitytoliveindependentlyfrom eachother,ortoformsmallercommunities,asnuclearfamilies.Butevennow,inmodernword andinmodernfamilies,wecanseepeoplecontinuetoactinaltruisticway.So,let’stryto discover,whatothermotives,besidesancienthabit,dotheyhave.

Oneofthemechanisms,whichmakespeopleactinaltruisticway,iscalledreciprocal(or mutual)altruism.Itmeans,thatindividualstendtohelpsomeone,whoislikelytogive somethingback.Butitdoesn’tmean,thathumanbeingsareegoistic.Peoplesubconsciously waitforthesameattitudetothemafterperformingaltruisticactions(therethegoldenruleof morality2istakenplace).AlexanderShmakov,theauthorofthearticle“Thepurposeforjust cooperationasamotiveofeconomicbehavior”,providesuswithresultsoftheexperiment, whichshowstherelevancyofthestatement,whichwasmadeabove:

Bothoftwoplayers(AandB)wereprovidedwithacertainamountofmoney(aandb respectively).Firstly,playerAisaskedtogiveapartofhismoneytoplayerB,andafterthat playerBisalsoaskedtogivemoneytoA.Bothplayersarefreetochooseanyamountofmoney (xoryrespectively)theywanttogiveornottogiveanythingatall.

Therationalstrategyforbothplayerswillbenotgivemoney.Becauseincase,whenAdecided toshare,itwouldnotbeprofitableforBtosharemoney(b+xa—yb&lt;b+xa).AndifAdecided nottogivemoney,Bwouldnotgivemoneyeither.However,inreality,whentheexperiment tookplace,theresultsshowedthat20of30pairsofstudentssharedtheirmoney.Theaverage receivedsumofmoneywere32,5%oftheinitialone.Butincase,whenoneoftheplayers

deniedtheopportunityofcooperationones,inmostofthecasesitputtheendforthefuture transaction,astheconditionofrelicensewaslost.

Onemorething,whichcanhelpustounderstandthephenomenonofaltruism,iseconomic games.Thereexistalotofsuchgames,butthemostfamousare“Dictator”,“Ultimatum”and “Thedivisionofthepublicgood”. In“Dictator”gameonetheplayersreceivesasumofmoney, partofwhichhe/shecangivetoanotherplayer.Therationalbehavior,whichisexpectedfrom thefirstperson,isnottogiveanything,asonlyinthiscasehe/shewillgetthemaximum possibleprofit.Strangely,butin616experiments3,whichwerecarriedout,anaveragegiven sumwasabout28,35%oftheinitialsumandonlyabout1/3ofallparticipantsgavenothing.The motiveforsuchaltruisticactionisprobablyasenseofjustice,asthefirstpersondidnothingin ordertogetmoney,sohe/shethinks,thatitwouldbefairtosharethem.

Anotherexplanationofaltruismispeople’sconsciousnessabouttheirreputation.AsI mentionedabove,altruismissociallyapprovedbehavior,soindividuals,whoareknownfor helpingpeoplearound,maybeinmorerespect,thanothers.So,themotivesforthealtruistic actionscanbenotonlyempathy,butalsoconcernfortheopinionofothers. Charitydonations areagoodexampleofanaltruisticaction,whichhasaconsiderableimpactinperson’s reputation.Inmostofthecharitycasesonlysmalldonationsaremadeanonymously,but namesofpeople,whodonatehugeamountsofmoney,areusuallywell-knownandnumerous timesmentionedinnewspapers,magazinesandTVprograms.So,philanthropistsmayexpect moresupportfromthesociety,iftheyneed,astheyareknownasagoodperson.

Developingtheideaaboutphilanthropy,wefaceanotherreasonforbeingaltruistic.This motiveisaboutbeingconsciousofthefutureofthecivilization,alsoknownascommunal interest,whichdifferpeoplefromanimals.Peoplewanttoliveincomfortableconditions, wherehospitals,educationandothersocialinstitutionsworkwellenough.So,theyarereadyto contributetothecommongoodinordertoprovidetheirfamiliesandthemselveswithbetter life.Thatiswhytheideaofsocialaltruismappeared.Scientistsfacedthefact,thattheyare unabletoexplainwhypeoplecontinuehelpotherseven,whentheydonothaveanyfiliationat all.Thistypeofbehaviorstartedtotakeplace,whenhuman’sintentionsgoesbeyondfamily andreputationalaltruism.ErnstFehrandUrsFischbacherintheirarticle“Natureofhuman altruism”callthisphenomenonastrongreciprocity,whichworksunderthepossibilityof altruisticremunerationoraltruisticpunishment(stigmatization).

Takingallthingsintoconsideration,wecanconclude,thataltruismhasasignificanteconomic effectnotonlyononeparticularpersonorasmallsocialgroup,butonthewholesociety.And strange,asitmayseem,altruisticbehaviorcanbeprofitableforthealtruistaswellasfor someone,whoreceiveshelp.Moreover,manysocialorganizations,eveneconomicones,would notworkatall,ifpeoplebehavedthemselvesonlyinegoisticway,asduetodesiretogetthe maximumpossibleprofitpeoplemaybreakadoptedregulations,whatmayruinthewhole system.

What exactly is a mind map? According to the definition of Buzan T. and Buzan B. (1999, Dessine-moi  l'intelligence. Paris: Les Éditions d'Organisation.), the mind map (or heuristic diagram) is a graphic  representation technique that follows the natural functioning of the mind and allows the brain's  potential to be released. Cf Annex1

This tool has many advantages:

•  It is accessible to all and does not require significant material investment and can be done  quickly

•  It is scalable

•  It allows categorization and linking of information

•  It can be applied to any type of situation: notetaking, problem solving, analysis, creation of  new ideas

•  It is suitable for all people and is easy to learn

•  It is fun and encourages exchanges

•  It makes visible the dimension of projects, opportunities, interconnections

•  It synthesizes

•  It makes the project understandable

•  It allows you to explore ideas

The creation of a mind map starts with an idea/problem located at its center. This starting point  generates ideas/work areas, incremented around this center in a radial structure, which in turn is  completed with as many branches as new ideas.

This tool enables creativity and logic to be mobilized, it is a map of the thoughts.

Creativity is enhanced because participants feel comfortable with the method.

Application &amp; Insight

I start the process of the mind map creation with the stakeholders standing around a large board  (white or paper board). In the center of the board, I write and highlight the topic to design.

Through a series of questions, I guide the stakeholders in modelling the mind map. I adapt the series  of questions according to the topic to be addressed. In the type of questions, we can use: who, what,  when, where, why, how, how much.

The use of the “why” is very interesting to understand the origin. By this way, the interviewed person  frees itself from paradigms and thus dares to propose new ideas / ways of functioning. I plan two  hours for a workshop.

Design Thinking for innovation reflexion-Avril 2021-Nathalie Sylla

After modelling the mind map on paper, I propose to the participants a digital visualization of their  work with the addition of color codes, images and interconnections. This second workshop also lasts  two hours and allows the mind map to evolve. Once familiarized with it, the stakeholders discover  the power of the tool. Then, the second workshop brings out even more ideas and constructive  exchanges between the stakeholders. Around this new mind map, they have learned to work  together and want to make visible the untold ideas.

I now present all the projects I manage in this type of format in order to ease rapid understanding for  decision-makers. These presentations are the core of my business models. The decision-makers are  thus able to identify the opportunities of the projects and can take quick decisions to validate them.  They find answers to their questions thank to a schematic representation.

Approach

What I find amazing with the facilitation of this type of workshop is the participants commitment for  the project. This tool helps to give meaning. The participants appropriate the story and want to keep  writing it. Then, they easily become actors or sponsors of the project. A trust relationship is built,  thus facilitating the implementation of related actions.

Design Thinking Assignment

Visualization Tool

Challenge &amp; Selection

The elderly were having a hard time adapting to the changes we brought in our bank. As  a result of a poorly implemented linear solution, a more customer centric approach was  needed.

After learning about design thinking in this course, we decided to apply it to solve this  problem. The visualization tool allowed the team to create a dynamic presentation using  diagrams, figures and drawings on the go that really resonated among the stakeholders.  Previous to this change, none of our solutions seemed to be adequate for them, but the  new implementation created a different type of connection with them that helped them  understand the problem in the way the team and I did.

Application

The process starts in the prep time. The team uses a series of tools and software to  develop a presentation using the surveys gathered during research and the solutions we  created during the process. The use of graphs to quickly show statistics in a fully visual  way, rather than verbally was a game changer.

After having a presentation prepared, the team hands an activity to the stakeholders,  where the solutions discussed previously appear. Nonetheless, the solutions need more  work to them. After this. The stakeholders are asked to help complete the solutions  while the team and I create diagrams on a blackboard to represent how their  suggestions would impact on this specific problem.

The use of a group activity strengthens the bond between the company and their  investors. It makes them feel like they take part and help solve the problems as well as  show how customer centric the solutions are. Every complaint and suggestion from  customers are read and evaluated using the graph shown in the course (Involving: can  we do it? Can we afford it? …). The finalization of this activity leaves the team and the  stakeholders on the same page. It allows them to completely understand and feel part  of the solution and also gives them the chance to ask better questions, which eases the  work of the team.

Insight &amp; Approach

The use of this method created a new workflow in the Design Team. It increased the  productivity and the success rate as well as the customer/stakeholders satisfaction. The  use of the visualization tool created an engaged group of people who work together to

Diego Estrada

find a solution based on their customer satisfaction. This solution is later revised and  tweaked with the help of the stakeholders who are deeply involved in the process.

Presentations, graphics, and activities have added a huge increase in satisfaction. As a  company we also learnt that engaging different areas can be difficult because of the  varying levels of understanding, but when paired with the adequate process things just  flow.

Challenge

I received a promotion of being the Regional Controller, along with my actual position of

Country CFO. The main responsibility of this new position was to weekly report the results

for the week and estimate the final results of the month of 4 countries and consolidated

those.

When I was receiving the position, I went to visit my colleague, former Regional Controller,

who was promoted to Country CEO and now had interest conflicts of being the controller.

The process to consolidate the information of the 4 countries was that the country controllers

sent him an email with the main figures for the week, he forwarded those to his country

accountant who consolidated it, the accountant sent him the consolidated report and he

finally reported to the headquarters. The whole process took almost a full business day to

complete.

Given that my responsibilities as Country CFO demanded more attention because my

country had more operations, I decided to change the process in order to reduce the

duration and to ensure standardization in the format, and actually, reduce the human

intervention, making that the country controllers work directly in the consolidation file.

Selection

Having in mind that there was a different kind of users of file, I select some of those to

determine what was the main important things to take into account in the moment of the

process of the information and the reading of the same. In that sense, we form a group of

the country controllers, country CEOs, IT guys, and people from the headquarters to find the

best solutions possible.

Application

For the first lunch, we focused on the consolidation process in order to avoid the copy-paste

processes and reducing the manual intervention so, we build an online application where all

the controllers fill the figure of their respective country, along with the comments. During the

first week of the first stage, we sent the new report along with the old one, and after the

meeting with the headquarters team, we ask for a post-meeting review of the new format, all

the assistants provided their comments and suggestions that were the input for the next

report.

For the second lunch, we focused on the feedback received from the assistants to the review

meeting, we adjust the report and we were able to eliminate the old one. The final report

included all the suggestions received but the best of all is that reduced the time investment

from about 36 men hours to around 8, without missing any valuable information and

including new data that the stakeholders appreciated so much.

Insight

With the application of the learning launch tool, the controller’s team along with the main

stakeholders identified different assumptions and designed tools to test these assumptions.

On the other hand, we found probable requirements from headquarters, expecting to find

that a more agile approach that improved the workflow, reduced the time investment of

everyone in the team and that both our team and the key stakeholders were very satisfied

with the results of the exercise and the new report.

The final report was slightly different from what we anticipated, but the differences were

more related to form and a few topics to be included in the report.

Approach

Despite that, the team was not used to design thinking tools, they were able to work with the

learning launch that was the appropriate tool. The team needs to review the insight gained

from our first two launches and continuously evaluate this insight and new ones into future

launch designs, especially taking into account that the full automation of the reports will take

at least 4 years more according to the ERP implementation plan of the headquarter.

Challenge

My challenge to solve is the problem of a company that is without

sufficient capital to create and build its own industrial plant, and cannot

cope with the growing demand that they have had in the last two months.

The company is in a dilemma, as it has two potential investors; The first

investor offers the amount of capital necessary for the creation of the

plant, in return he asks to intervene in the process and make certain

changes in the final product since he thinks that the idea he has has

shown good results in previous years and to have the participation of 50%

in the company, the second investor offers the capital necessary for the

creation of the plant in exchange for do not make modifications to the

final product, since this is the one that is generating the exponential

growth of the company, for the moment it is only asked to focus on the

company's success product and as they recover the investment they can

be extended to the innovation of products and creation for a 20% stake

within the company.

As a manager of the company, I need to make the best decision for the

above mentioned one.

Selection

I decided to choose the visualization tool, visualization allows me to

understand and analyze the context, to be able to define the needs and

their possible solutions. This tool is useful for me to have a clearer vision

of the current state of the company and what it ultimately requires;

through this tool I can deduce the personalities of the two investors, such

as George and Geoff; and based on this I can make the best decision.

Application

In the application of my chosen tool to the challenge that I have set

myself, the tool has been of a very wide utility, since when applying it to

my challenge very good results were obtained, since with this I could have

an analysis to the measure of the two investors. The first thing I did with

my visualization tool was to conduct a study to customers who required

the flagship product of the company, first I had to understand why the

demand had had such a strong growth in the last two months, by applying

the tool I could find the answers to this question; I could see that

customers needed this product as it was, without any modification

because the product worked wonders.

With this study of the clients interested in the product, I was able to

analyze and follow up on the proposals I had on the table from the two

investors.

I concluded that I needed the person who was interested in the first

instance to supply the product that was having great success. Which was

the second investor, since he was interested in first of all to give the size

of production that our customers demanded, and then worry about

improving it, but in small and concise steps.

I discarded the first investor, as he did not meet the requirements that the

company needed at that time. I realized that this investor was convinced

that by changing the product to the way he thought, the demand was

going to increase more; but in reality what the company needed was to be

able to cover the demand that the product was having, this investor

wanted to throw everything we had, to the side of the road, but he did not

think for a moment that these modifications should have a low impact in

case things do not go as well as expected.

Thanks to the application of the tool I was able to identify the key points

of the company's needs and how each investor, according to their

proposals, could help me, based on this I made the best decision. I chose

to work with the second investor, we were able to supply the demand for

the product, then the investment tripled and we were able to inject it into

research for product innovation, and make some small changes, which

were being introduced to customers discreetly and in small quantities.

When customers became more interested in the improved product, we

decided to increase production by improving the product.

Perspective

The information and the final lesson that I had when socializing what we

obtained by using the visualization tool, the first thing is that we must

always think first about the needs of customers, of the people interested

in the product; it is very useful to know what the problem is, what is the

cause of the problem and finally build an effective solution. Secondly,

based on what we have obtained, we can find a partner that fits our

needs, and be able to work as a team, unifying ideas and producing

possible solutions. Thanks to the knowledge gained from the design

course, I was able to create a strategic plan for the company's problems

and make it a successful plan.

Approach

What I would apply differently in the challenge would be the tool used, I

would like to use the learning launch; I would do it in the following way,

rejecting the proposals of the two investors and only creating the way that

the production process would be decreased to be able to supply the

required demand. It may or may not work out, but I would like to have

employed this strategy.

Challenge

We are a small company in Barcelona (Spain) that refines high-quality organic cheeses  from small producers in the Pyrenees. We also trade milk and yogurts from these  producers. We distribute our dairy products mainly to haute cuisine restaurants (60% of  our turnover) and to Delicatesens stores (35% of our turnover), the remaining 5% we  distribute to individuals, mainly family, friends and acquaintances.    Selection

I have chosen the "Learning Launch" because it is more adapted to my way of working  and the needs of the company.    Application

Due to the coronavirus crisis, all restaurants have closed and Delicatesen store sales  have dropped dramatically. therefore we have had to change our target niche and head  towards private individuals and common stores.    We have carried out a survey both in small stores and among individuals. In the survey  we asked what types of cheese are the most willing to consume, as well as milk and  yogurts, also the type of milk (goat, cow, sheep), the level of curing and the price they  would be willing to pay for our products. We have also proposed sending boxes with  different products on offer, in which the average price is significantly lower.    After the survey and the observations of individuals and small stores, we have focused  our offer on a certain type of product, we have distributed it and analyzed the result not  only with our customers but also with objective sales figures.    Insight

The result has been spectacular, our weekly turnover had fallen to 25% with a loss of  75% (60% of restaurants and 15% of delicatessen stores). The situation was dramatic  but nowadays sales to individuals have risen from 5% to 25% and common food stores  have gone from 0% to 15%.

Approach

Our situation is not good, but we hope that when the restaurants open and the economy  recovers. We will have a much broader portfolio of clients and a way of working based  on the client and transferred to the producer. Before, we used to transfer products from  small producers to customers. Now the flow has changed.

Be it any organization, team or a government venture, I have often observed that they experience  failures because they couldn’t connect with their audience aptly. In such scenarios, storytelling  can turn the table significantly. I have used the tool ‘storytelling’ in my organization to convey a  complicated message as simply as possible or to generate ideas from people around me. The idea  is to implement this innovative tool to make the intricate issues understandable and engage the  targeted audience. I relayed the context of the story to captivate the attention of the audience. I  have used the technique in front of my team-members of the organization to impart its essence,  brainstorm notions, make productive connections and develop appropriate strategies. The crucial  element in storytelling is to engagingly answer the questions raised in the story to its targeted  audience and allow them to resonate with the core subject of the story. When I shared the story, I  tried to gain the insights from the audience as to how the characters inspire them and how it  related to their work emotions. The information and feedback immensely helped me in  recognizing its importance in finding solutions in real world.

Application

I used the storytelling tool in an organizational meeting to help the team members visualize the  essence and impact of revolutionary thinking. I understood that the story has to make sense so  that they can comprehend the context and relate with it. I started the story of the time when there  was an emergence of deadly diseases due to mosquitoes i.e. malaria etc. and a company brought  a revolution by introducing a range of mosquito repellent products. I emphasized on its out-of- the box thinking &amp; ideas that made the brand conquer the market. I observed that my audience  were sincerely engaged and were emotionally connected with the company. After I finished, there  were questions and productive interactions which exhibited that they relate it with their ongoing  project. The enthusiasm of thinking afresh was quite overwhelming.

Insight &amp; Approach

When I analysed the whole series of events it made me wonder, “Did my tool work? The answer I  think is ‘YES’. Will it serve the purpose? I think that time will tell but I believe it will certainly aid  them in making apt strategies.”

The exercise portrayed that a revolutionary story can influence a small number of people then  storytelling as a design-thinking tool, if implemented efficiently, can bring ground-breaking  changes in organizations &amp; countries. I observed that my story engaged my targeted audience,  inspired them to think new and deliver better results.

As a student of design thinking, I can explore this tool from all corners and can confidently say  that I can creatively use it in number of inspiring ways at any appropriate phase of design thinking  activities.

Challenge

I take part of a social enterprenuership group in my university. We were in contact

with Capão das Antas, a rural Community in the suburbs of São Carlos (SP-Brazil). We had the  intention to criate, with the local producers, a project that wold improve the quality of life in  the neighborhood. For that, in the first two months we begin to listen each farmer of Capão  and try identify the principal issues of the place and their residentes. After some visits we  concluded that the principal problem was selling the products that they plant in the local  farms. Therefore, we had the objective to make and test a business model that would increase  their rent.

Selection

In order to build a sustainable business model with the farmers, we made a first test

were we delivered the products at the costumer’s door. The action had a good result but we  want to increase even more ours sales. So we used Learning Launchs to test new ideais and  then improve our business model.

Application

After we analise all the data we had and build the business model, Its was far from be

the most sustainable and profitable one. To improve our project, we made a plan to test new  ways of seling. So every week, after we analise all the process from the farm to the costumer  door, we propose and teste the improvement in the current business model.

In order to give examples of how it works, after some weeks we notice that the

farmers were having problems in separate the orders. The costumers were ordering with na  app called whatsapp, but the person who was responsable for taking note of the orders was  messy with the conversations feed. As soon as we notice this problem we proposed a new app  that automatically cluster the orders in a simple feed. Therefore we tested this improvement  in the next week and got zero mistakes in separating the orders.

Insights

The application of Learning Launches showed me how testing is importante in building

a solid business model. Therefore, I learned that the more you test possibles ideias, more  chance of sucess you have. Testing a lot of improvement and ideas is not the fastest way to  achieve a better scenario but is cleary a certainly strategy to get there.

Approach

During all the improvement plan that we act every week we propose changes based on

what we were seeing during the deliveries. I think that we could have achieved better results  by analysis more sources of data, like feedback from all the stakeholders. Besides that we  could have made a better knowledge management of the changes proposed for the business  model.

Topic 7

“Why are people sometimes altruistic?”

Stefano Lovato

MDI-191 student

Sathyabama

April, 2020

In many classical economic theories, it is common to determine a human, as a very egoistic  creature. Adam Smith’s books (but not all of them) were wrote based on this idea also.  However, the conception of Homo economicus was introduced for the first time by John Stuart  Mill in the nineteens century and it assumes, that all human beings are consistently rational,  narrowly self-interested, and who pursue their subjectively-defined ends optimally1. However,  in our real life we face acts of altruism very often: our parents provide us with all necessary  goods, a lot of businessmen give money for charity and even strangers give money to homeless  people. So, it is very clear, that people do not necessarily acts in their own interests all the time,  they also tend to help others. But what makes them to do this? Why are people sometimes  altruistic?

Gerashchenko Igor in his article “The ethical teaching of A. Smith in the context of the modern  economy” writes, that altruism has been existing from the very times of primitive man, as a  single egoistic individual was not capable to survive out of his or her community. All resources  were so difficult to get, that the efforts of the whole pride were essential in struggle for  survival. The following way the system of social values, where helping other people is highly  appreciated, started to form. The ideology of individualism instead of collectivism has appeared  much time later, when the market economy gave us a possibility to live independently from  each other, or to form smaller communities, as nuclear families. But even now, in modern word  and in modern families, we can see people continue to act in altruistic way. So, let’s try to  discover, what other motives, besides ancient habit, do they have.

One of the mechanisms, which makes people act in altruistic way, is called reciprocal (or  mutual) altruism. It means, that individuals tend to help someone, who is likely to give  something back. But it doesn’t mean, that human beings are egoistic. People subconsciously  wait for the same attitude to them after performing altruistic actions (there the golden rule of  morality2 is taken place). Alexander Shmakov, the author of the article “The purpose for just  cooperation as a motive of economic behavior”, provides us with results of the experiment,  which shows the relevancy of the statement, which was made above:

Both of two players (A and B) were provided with a certain amount of money (a and b  respectively). Firstly, player A is asked to give a part of his money to player B, and after that  player B is also asked to give money to A. Both players are free to choose any amount of money  (x or y respectively) they want to give or not to give anything at all.

The rational strategy for both players will be not give money. Because in case, when A decided  to share, it would not be profitable for B to share money (b + xa — yb &lt; b + xa). And if A decided  not to give money, B would not give money either. However, in reality, when the experiment  took place, the results showed that 20 of 30 pairs of students shared their money. The average  received sum of money were 32,5% of the initial one. But in case, when one of the players

1 The definition is taken from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_economicus .  2 Treat people the way you want to be treated.

Player A / Player B  To give money  Not to give

To give money  a + yb — xa, b + xa — yb  a — xa, b + xa

Not to give  a + yb, b — yb  a, b

denied the opportunity of cooperation ones, in most of the cases it put the end for the future  transaction, as the condition of relicense was lost.

One more thing, which can help us to understand the phenomenon of altruism, is economic  games. There exist a lot of such games, but the most famous are “Dictator”, “Ultimatum” and  “The division of the public good”.  In “Dictator” game one the players receives a sum of money,  part of which he/she can give to another player. The rational behavior, which is expected from  the first person, is not to give anything, as only in this case he/she will get the maximum  possible profit. Strangely, but in 616 experiments3, which were carried out, an average given  sum was about 28,35% of the initial sum and only about 1/3 of all participants gave nothing. The  motive for such altruistic action is probably a sense of justice, as the first person did nothing in  order to get money, so he/she thinks, that it would be fair to share them.

Another explanation of altruism is people’s consciousness about their reputation. As I  mentioned above, altruism is socially approved behavior, so individuals, who are known for  helping people around, may be in more respect, than others. So, the motives for the altruistic  actions can be not only empathy, but also concern for the opinion of others.  Charity donations  are a good example of an altruistic action, which has a considerable impact in person’s  reputation. In most of the charity cases only small donations are made anonymously, but  names of people, who donate huge amounts of money, are usually well-known and numerous  times mentioned in newspapers, magazines and TV programs. So, philanthropists may expect  more support from the society, if they need, as they are known as a good person.

Developing the idea about philanthropy, we face another reason for being altruistic. This  motive is about being conscious of the future of the civilization, also known as communal  interest, which differ people from animals. People want to live in comfortable conditions,  where hospitals, education and other social institutions work well enough. So, they are ready to  contribute to the common good in order to provide their families and themselves with better  life. That is why the idea of social altruism appeared. Scientists faced the fact, that they are  unable to explain why people continue help others even, when they do not have any filiation at  all. This type of behavior started to take place, when human’s intentions goes beyond family  and reputational altruism. Ernst Fehr and Urs Fischbacher in their article “Nature of human  altruism” call this phenomenon a strong reciprocity, which works under the possibility of  altruistic remuneration or altruistic punishment (stigmatization).

Taking all things into consideration, we can conclude, that altruism has a significant economic  effect not only on one particular person or a small social group, but on the whole society. And  strange, as it may seem, altruistic behavior can be profitable for the altruist as well as for  someone, who receives help. Moreover, many social organizations, even economic ones, would  not work at all, if people behaved themselves only in egoistic way, as due to desire to get the  maximum possible profit people may break adopted regulations, what may ruin the whole  system.
